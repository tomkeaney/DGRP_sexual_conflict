# Potential research questions

First up, Walsh and Lynch raise an important point: to compare variances between traits, one needs a standardised measure. _Houle (1992)_ suggests the **coefficient of additive genetic variance, $CV_A = \sigma_A / \mu$**, where \mu is the trait mean. Houle coined this term _evolvability_.

## Testing general predictions of Fisher's theorem 

1. Do traits correlated with fitness have lower heritabilities?

Following Fisher's theorem and assuming a constant environment, in the absence of new variation, selection is expected to erode all additive genetic variation for fitness. One implication of this expectation is that traits that are correlated with fitness should show reduced additive genetic variance relative to those that are not correlated with fitness _(Robertson 1955b)_. 

There are previous studies that have compared fitness related traits i.e. those implicated with reproduction, with morphological traits, which are assumed to have lesser relationships with fitness.

- The problem is associating these traits with _lifetime) fitness. This shouldn't be such a problem for us...

- Multiple studies looking at this corollary use phenotypic correlations with fitness rather than genetic. Once again, this is no problem for us...

- Even if there is lots of additive genetic variance for a trait and it is correlated with fitness, if fitness has a high environmental variance component the strength of selection on the trait will be weak.

_Houle (1992)_ looks like an important meta-analysis type work

2. Do traits correlated with fitness have higher levels of both additive and residual variance

Note that heritability can also decline with an increase in environmental variance and no decrease (or an increase) in genetic variance. If true, this makes a simple regression with heritability and fitness misleading.

Using evolvability as his metric, Houle (1992) found that characters assumed to be closely related to fitness have higher evolvabilities than do trait with looser relationships to fitness. This suggests that the negative relationship between fitness and heritability is due to increased environmental variance in fitness related traits, not a decrease in additive genetic variance. 

## Testing hypotheses relating to sexually antagonstic selection

1. **Is there a negative relationship between the intersex genetic correlation and sexual dimorphism?**

If there is, it means that a shared genetic architecture between the sexes constrains the ability of selection to move traits towards their separate female and male optimas. 

Intralocus sexual conflict should therefore be stronger for traits that are more constrained by the intersex genetic correlation.

If there isn't, the resolution of intralocus sexual conflict may be easier than expected i.e. sharing a genome may not be the problem we think it is.

2. **Is selection stronger on reproductive traits than it is on viability related traits?**

3. **Is SA selection stronger on these reproductive traits than viability related traits**

4. **Does SA selection positively correlate with sexual dimorphism?**

This one is a little tricky. One might expect a positive relationship, because why else would the trait be sexually dimorphic? But perhaps dimorphism has evolved to the extent that the conflict is resolved. The question is whether current dimorphism affects selection??

If a males trait optima = 5 and a females = 10. No dimorphism, while assuming equally strong selection on both sexes, would suggest a trait mean of 7.5 for both sexes. Alleles that increase the mean will be favoured in females but selected against in males. 

Now if there is strong dimorphism. Selection on the trait stays the same - higher vales are selected in females and selected against in males. But females and males are more dissimilar now, such that alleles that effect males in one way don't necessarily affect females in the same way.

Upon reflection, I believe this is a way to test whether intralocus sexual conflict is ongoing in the DGRP population, or if it has been resolved by sexual dimorphism. If we observe a positive relationship between SA selection and dimorphism, this is indicative of ongoing sexual conflict i.e. dimorphism is incomplete. If there is a negative relationship, this is indicative of dimorphism being an effective resolution to sexual conflict. No relationship indicates that...

A broad prediction for this one still isn't clear for me.

5. **Is selection more concordant in stressful conditions? And does stress increase the strength of selection?**

Theory suggests it should, because male and female condition/fitness become more aligned in stressful environments. To illustrate this point, consider fitness in two contexts a) a benign environment where fitness depends on an individuals interaction with conspecifics and b) a stressful environment, where a large component of fitness is tied to viability/condition. The first context leaves plenty of room for sex-specific fitness, while the second is likely to effect the sexes in a similar way - they face a common hardship, which aligns fitness in the sexes.

6. **Do genomes with greater across the board sexual dimorphism have higher fitness?**

The thinking here is that escaping sexual conflict increases fitness. Those DGRP that aren't dimorphic are stuck suffering the consequences of conflict. Whether this hypothesis stacks up is dependent on the existence of genetic variation for sexual dimorphism across a whole range of traits. It may be that dimorphism is trait rather than genotype specific.

7. **Are selection differentials across traits stronger for males than they are for females?**

## Calculating r^A^~*z fm*~ for all traits

$~$

The traits we consider in this analysis fall into four categories. 1) They have been measured in the two sexes separately, 2) they have only been measured females, 3) they have only been measured in males and 4) they have been measured across the two sexes. For those traits that fall into category 1, we can calculate r^A^~*fm*~.

We use bayesian models to find the residual correlation between traits expressed in males and females. Each line represents a different genotype, and we have measures for both sexes per line. This correlation therefore corresponds to the additive intersex genetic correlation for each trait.

A problem here is that my current approach assumes that each trait is normally distributed, which is clearly false. This is the same problem that researchers face with the spearman correlation coefficient, and the main reason we have used the pearson method in earlier analyses. To solve this problem, I can categorise each trait into a 'distribution family' then run the models in subsets. Using this bayesian approach is preferred because it gives us measures of uncertainty which you don't get from the pearson frequentist approach. **Currently not done**

**Figure 1**: The intersex additive genetic correlation for traits that have been measured in both sexes in > 80 DGRP lines. A value of 0 indicates that there is no intersex genetic correlation, while a value of 1 means that additive genetic effects in one sex affect the other one identically. Data are means (depicted as 5% uncertainty intervals) with 66% and 95% uncertainty intervals.

## Calculating sexual dimorphism for all traits

$~$

Sexual dimorphism is a distinct concept from the intersex genetic correlation. The intersex genetic correlation is the correlation between the effects of alleles on females and males. When this is high, the sexes are affected by alleles in a similar way. However, a high $r_{fm}$ does not necessarily main that there is not sexual dimorphism, which is the difference in the trait mean between females and males. If processes other than genetic variation affect phenotype, then sexual dimorphism can be decoupled from $r_{fm}$. For example, suppose an allele affects a trait expressed by both sexes in the same direction, but that it is expressed to different extents in the two sexes. This will result in a positive genetic correlation, but a sexually dimorphic trait.

Recall that we calculated $r_{fm}$ as the residual correlation between trait means for each line that had been scaled within their sex groupings. To calculate sexual dimorphism, we instead scale trait means across both sexes. This means that a male that has a high trait value relative to other males can still have a low trait value if females have higher trait values on average. 

We fit the model `Trait_value ~ 1 + (Sex|Trait)` to estimate the effect of sex on trait means.Specifically, use the $\beta$ estimate for the effect of `Sex:Male` on the mean for each trait to estimate sexual dimorphism.

**Figure 2**: Sexual dimorphism scores for traits that have been phenotyped in females and males. Positive values indicate that males have higher trait values than females, a value of 0 indicates that there is no sexual dimorphism, and negative values indicate that females have higher trait values than males. Bars represent means (displayed as 5% CI intervals), 66% and 95% intervals.

# What effect does the intersex genetic correlation have on sexual dimorphism?

$~$

To answer this question, we take the absolute value of our dimorphism measure. While this means we are unable to identify which sex has the higher trait value, it allows us to test whether there is a negative relationship between $r_{fm}$ and sexual dimorphism, as predicted if $r_{fm}$ holds the sexes back from attaining their phenotypic optima.

**Figure 3**: The intersex genetic correlation for a trait does not affect sexual dimorphism in the trait. Panel a shows the entire dataset, while panels b-g show traits broken down into broad guilds. Note that guilds with less than 10 traits are not shown.

$~$

This analysis is not perfect! However, there does not appear to be any substantial effect of the intersex genetic correlation on sexual dimorphism This suggests that sharing a genome may not be the constraint on adaptation that is often assumed (at least in the DGRP).

## Calculating _I_: the opportunity for selection

$~$

We run into the **problem** that fitness has been standardised, meaning that variance is uniform and known i.e. SD = 1. I think we need raw values?

_I_ is the variance in relative fitness within a population, and represents the upper bound for a change in any trait due to selection within a generation. The usefulness of _I_ for working out how selection changes trait values depends upon the correlation of the trait in question with relative fitness. The stronger this correlation, the more insightful _I_ becomes. This correlation is the Price-Robertson identity, $S = \sigma(z, w)$, which we shall consider later.

Here we calculate _I_ to set a bound for the maximum intensity of selection that is possible in our population, within the environmental conditions that our fitness measurements occurred. _I_ is estimated by
$$\hat{I} =\frac{n}{n-1}(\overline{w}^{2} - 1)$$
where n is the number of individuals that we have measured fitness for (in our case lines), and $\overline{w}^{2}$ is the mean of the squared relative fitness in the population. To calculate relative fitness we need to know the mean proportion of offspring produced across lines (our measure of fitness), then divide each lines individual fitness measure by this number. This will not work for scaled data. **Ask Luke for unscaled means**

**No work on this yet**

$~$

## Calculating *S*: the selection differential

$~$

The selection differential is the change in trait mean that occurs within a generation. Positive values indicate positive directional selection, while negative values indicate negative directional selection. We can calculate the selection differential associated with each phenotype using the **Robertson Price identity**, which states that the selection differential is equivalent to the covariance between phenotype and relative fitness

$S = \sigma(w_i, z_i)$

or

$S = cov(relative.fitness, standarised.phenotype)$

To do this, I use bayesian analysis, so that we get uncertainty estimates on the selection differentials. We have standardised each trait to have mean = 0 and SD = 1. Therefore, if $S$ = 0.25, this can be interpreted as a change of 0.25 standard deviations in the mean within a generation. However, this does not represent a change in the mean across generations because $S$ provides no information about the inheritance of the trait. 

We can also calculate the broad sense heritability associated with each phenotype... if we could calculate the narrow sense heritability we could use the **Breeder's equation**, $\Delta Z = h^2S$, to calculate the response to selection for each phenotype (I don't think we can do this).

## Identifying traits under sexually antagonistic selection

$~$

We have found selection differentials acting on traits in females and males. For those traits where we have a measure of both, we can quantify sexually antagonistic selection by finding traits that have selection operating in opposite directions, depending on which sex the trait is expressed in. 

[Innocenti and Morrow (2011)]( https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01021.x) present an index for measuring the intensity for sexually antagonistic selection:

Where $B'_F$ = $S_F$ and $B'_M$ = $S_M$ that we have calculated above.

From **Innocenti and Morrow**:

This index is positive when selection is concordant in the two sexes, negative when antagonistic in the two sexes, and is zero when selection is absent in one sex (note that it will miss conflict that occurs when strong stabilizing selection is present in that sex). Finally it is proportional to the absolute intensity of selection.

Additionally, it has the desirable properties of being symmetrical and normally distributed for a random set of normally distributed β′M,β′F. |I| is also always included in the interval between the absolute values of the selection gradient in the two sexes, and it coincides with them when β′M = β′F. As a potential drawback, it should be noted that such quantity is not defined when β′M = β′F = 0, even though it makes little sense to estimate how concordant or antagonstic directional selection is when it is absent in both sexes.
