This website presents an analysis of selection acting on the DGRP. We particularly focus upon sexually antagonistic selection and test some well known hypotheses that relate to this concept.

## Analysis of phenotypic line means
We present analyses of heritability and correlations between line means [here](Main_analysis.html)

## Genome-wide association tests using PLINK
The code used to run GWA tests can be viewed [here](run_GWAS.html)

## Estimating genetic correlations from variants' effect sizes
Graphs and tables relating to genetic correlations between traits can be viewed [here](SNP_correlations.html)

## Multivariate adaptive shrinkage using `mashr`
The code used to run `mashr` can be viewed [here](run_mashr.html)

## Results of the `mashr` analyses
Graphs and tables relating to the output of `mashr` [here](process_mashr.html)

## SNP-heritabilities' and the Robertson-Price Identity

The code used to run GREML models to estimate SNP heritability and selection differentials [here](SNP_heritabilities.html)
