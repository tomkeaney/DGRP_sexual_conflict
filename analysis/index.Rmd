This website presents an analysis of the evolutionary response to selection in the DGRP. We are particularly interested in how the presence of separate sexes affects trait evolution. 

In the analysis we:

1. Identify the traits with the strongest predicted evolutionary responses in females and males.

2. Find the traits with the strongest overall responses to selection.

3. Test whether the average absolute response to selection is stronger in males than it is in females.

4. Find traits with different selection responses

5. Use an index of the concordance of selection responses to assess whether selection tends to be sexually concordant or sexually antagonistic.
