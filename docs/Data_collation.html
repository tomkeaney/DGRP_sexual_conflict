Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:

<h3>Line mean phenotype data provided by original authors</h3>
<p>Most of the papers that report DGRP data provide estimates of the
mean phenotype of multiple DGRP lines (“line mean data”). We conducted a
non-exhaustive search of the literature for phenotypic trait
measurements for DGRP lines, and collated all the line mean data in two
csv files; <code>all.line.mean.phenos.csv</code> which contains line
mean values for each trait and
<code>all.line.mean.phenos_metadata.csv</code> which contains study

<h3>Loading the line mean data calculated by us from the raw data</h3>
<p>Some studies only provide the raw data they collected when measuring
DGRP phenotypes (e.g. measurements of individual flies, with replicates
within each DGRP line). We need line mean data to calculate genetic
correlations between traits and run typical GWA analyses. To get line
means, we estimated them from the raw data as described in the script
<code>analysis/get_line_means_from_raw_data.Rmd</code>, which can be
viewed <a href="get_line_means_from_raw_data.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Removing unusual lines</h3>
<p>We have phenotype line means for {r num_unique_lines} lines, which is
more than we expected. There appear to be some lines that have been used
in very few studies, suggesting some of these lines reflect labelling
errors.</p>
<p>After checking the <a
href="https://bdsc.indiana.edu/Home/Search">Bloomington Drosophila Stock
Centre</a> and <a
href="http://flybase.org/reports/FBlc0000504.html">Flybase</a> we found
the following anomalies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Chapman et al (2020): lines 273, 331, 501, 568, 709, 831, 846 -
these lines are not phenotyped in any other study and are not documented
on flybase.</p></li>
<li><p>Palmer et al (2018): line 575 - not on Flybase</p></li>
<li><p>Chowdhury et al (2019): line 471 - not on Flybase (only aberrant
line from study)</p></li>
<li><p>Houston (2019): line 285 - not on Flybase</p></li>
<li><p>Watanabe and Riddle (2021): line 854 - not on Flybase</p></li>
<li><p>Battlay et al (2016): lines 226, 847 and 917 - there is no
obvious reason for these mysterious lines. There are no obvious typos
and the paper states they conduct GWA with 178 lines, which matches the
number reported in File S2, which is where we sourced the data.</p></li>
<li><p>Katzenberger et al (2015): line 521 - no obvious typo (data is
ordered by increasing trait value). One-off issue. Not on
Flybase.</p></li>
<li><p>Turner, Miller and Cochrane (2013): line 760 - no obvious typo.
One off. Not on Flybase.</p></li>
<li><p>Montgomery et al (2014): lines 424 and 766 - Errors appear to be
mislabelled lines. Table S3 includes RAL lines 424 and 766. Line 766 is
out of numeric order in the Table. Most likely to actually be line 776
or 786, but we cannot be sure.</p></li>
<li><p>He et al (2014): Bloomington stock number 28120 - Error appears
to be a typo. Line 28120 is included in the raw data, but isn’t listed
in Table S2 which shows the lines used in the study. One-off
issue.</p></li>
<li><p>Lafluente, Duneau and Beldade (2018): line 809 - Likely to be a
typo or a labelling error. One-off issue.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The following code removes these putatively erroneous lines from the
dataset:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># check how many traits each line has been phenotyped for

  all.dgrp.phenos_combined %&gt;% 
  filter(!(line %in% aberrant_lines))</code></pre>
<p>This still leaves 219 lines, which was unexpected because most
studies state that the DGRP consists of 205 lines. However, the DGRP
record on Flybase (<a href="http://flybase.org/reports/FBlc0000504.html"
class="uri">http://flybase.org/reports/FBlc0000504.html</a>) indicates
that a total of 219 lines have been included in the DGRP at some point
since its creation. We infer that some lines were withdrawn from the
Bloomington stock centre, explaining their absence from most DGRP
studies.</p>
<p>The lines that have been withdrawn but are included in our dataset
are: 80, 272, 343, 378, 387, 393, 398, 476, 514, 554, 556, 591, 750,
771. We chose <strong>not to remove</strong> these lines from our
dataset, as many of the studies we include in our dataset make use of
these lines.</p>

<h3>Removing lines that have multiple trait values</h3>
<p>For some traits, a small number of lines had &gt;1 trait value. We

but document our fixes here for transparency.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Unckless, Rottschaefer and Lazzaro (2015, <em>G3</em>) include
line 287 twice in their provided data. The trait values were identical,
so we simply removed the duplication.</p></li>
<li><p>Chow, Wolfner and Clark (2013, <em>PNAS</em>) include line 287
twice in their data (coincidence?). They measured two traits: a hazard
ratio for tunicamycin-induced survival and an LT50 value. Line 287 has
two different hazard ratios, but the same LT50 value. We therefore
removed line 287 completely from the hazard ratio dataset, but only
removed the duplicate in the LT50 dataset.</p></li>
<li><p>Hotson and Schneider (2015, <em>G3</em>) include line 712 twice
in their provided data, for the trait
<code>L.monocytogenes.load.m</code>. The duplicates provide different
values. Due to this ambiguity, we removed line 712 from the
dataset.</p></li>
<li><p>Adebambo et al (2020, <em>Frontiers in Genetics</em>) include the
line 229 twice. The trait values were identical, so we simply removed
the duplication.</p></li>

<h3>Save the cleaned dataset, with traits measured in the original

<p>Here, we save the {r n_traits_after_cleaning} traits as a .csv file
called <code>data/derived/all.dgrp.phenos_unscaled.csv</code>, which you
may wish to download and use in your research. The file contains 4
columns which give the name of the DGRP line (<code>line</code>), the
name of the trait being measured (<code>Trait</code>), the reference
(<code>Reference</code>), and the estimated mean value of the focal
trait in the focal DGRP line (<code>trait_value</code>).</p>
<p>To help interpret the contents of this file, we also save a metadata
file called <code>data/derived/meta_data_for_all_traits.csv</code>,
which gives information about each trait. This file is also shown in the
HTML Table below. The columns are interpreted as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>Trait</code>: The name of the trait. This matches the
traits listed in <code>data/derived/all.dgrp.phenos_unscaled.csv</code>,
and can be used to combine the two spreadsheets (e.g. by using a left
join, as in:
<code>dplyr::left_join(all.dgrp.phenos_unscaled, meta_data_for_all_traits)</code>)</p></li>
<li><p><code># lines measured</code>: Number of DGRP lines for estimates
of the line mean trait value was available.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Sex</code>: The sex of the flies being measured (Female,
Male, or Pooled, where the latter means flies of both sexes were
measured)</p></li>
<li><p><code>Life_stage</code>: the life stage at which flies were
phenotyped (Juvenile: all life stages that precede eclosion, and
adulthood: post eclosion)</p></li>
<li><p><code>Trait guild</code>: A categorisation of the type of trait
that was manually assigned by us to aid visualisation in
figures.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Trait description</code>: A description of how the trait,
including an explanation of the meaning of relatively high and low
values.</p></li>

Higher values indicate a greater plastic response.","Rapid cold hardening; a type of phenotypic plasticity that allows ectotherms to quickly enhance cold tolerance in response to brief chilling (lasting minutes to hours). This was measured by exposing one group of flies to a mild pre-treatment temperature before exposing them to a cold temperature, while another group of flies was immediately exposed to the cold temperature. RCH = prop survival after hardening – prop survival without hardening. These flies were reared under fluctuating controlled temperatures, with a mean of 23.8C ± 6, prior to phenotyping.

<h2>Save the cleaned dataset, with traits measured in standard

<p>Some of our traits have already been scaled to have a mean of zero
and standard deviation of 1. For consistency, and to aid comparison of
variances between traits, we also create and save a version of the
complete dataset where all traits have been standardised (by subtracting
the mean from each value and dividing by the standard deviation, via R’s
<code>scale()</code> function).</p>
