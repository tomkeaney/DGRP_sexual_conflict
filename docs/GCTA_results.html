Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/tomkeaney/DGRP_sexual_conflict/tree/30bb3361d85525486ef3d248640432867e3e7601" target="_blank">30bb336</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:

Data are originally displayed as a proportion from all CHCs detected. The name of each CHC can be deciphered as follows: linear alkanes are referred to by the abbreviation n-Cx, where ‘‘x’’ is the total carbon number. Methyl-branched alkanes are referred to with a y-Me-Cx prefix, where ’y’ is the carbon onto which the methyl group is bound. For example, 9-Me-C23 is a 23 carbon chain with a methyl on the 9th carbon.

<p><strong>1. Do traits correlated with fitness have lower heritabilities?</strong></p>
<p>Following Fisher’s theorem and assuming a constant environment, in the absence of new variation, selection is expected to erode all additive genetic variation for fitness. One implication of this expectation is that traits that are correlated with fitness should show reduced additive genetic variance relative to those that are not correlated with fitness <em>(Robertson 1955b)</em>.</p>
<p>There are previous studies that have compared fitness related traits i.e. those implicated with reproduction, with morphological traits, which are assumed to have lesser relationships with fitness.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The problem is associating these traits with _lifetime) fitness. This shouldn’t be such a problem for us…</p></li>
<li><p>Multiple studies looking at this corollary use phenotypic correlations with fitness rather than genetic. Once again, this is no problem for us…</p></li>
<li><p>Even if there is lots of additive genetic variance for a trait and it is correlated with fitness, if fitness has a high environmental variance component the strength of selection on the trait will be weak.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Houle (1992)</em> looks like an important meta-analysis type work</p>

<p>Figure X: The SNP-covariance between fitness and trait (Robertson covariance) is positively correlated with SNP heritability. The Robertson covariance, or the secondary theorem of natural selection, <span class="math inline">\(R_z\)</span> is the expected response to selection of a trait.</p>

<p><strong>2. Do traits correlated with fitness have higher levels of both additive and residual variance</strong></p>
<p>Note that heritability can also decline with an increase in environmental variance and no decrease (or an increase) in genetic variance. If true, this makes a simple regression with heritability and fitness misleading.</p>
<p>Using evolvability as his metric, <em>Houle (1992)</em> found that characters assumed to be closely related to fitness have higher evolvabilities than do trait with looser relationships to fitness. This suggests that the negative relationship between fitness and heritability is due to increased environmental variance in fitness related traits, not a decrease in additive genetic variance.</p>

<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(B_F\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B_M\)</span> are the standardised selection gradients for females and males respectively.</p>
<p>From <strong>Innocenti and Morrow</strong>:</p>
<p>This index is positive when selection is concordant in the two sexes, negative when antagonistic in the two sexes, and is zero when selection is absent in one sex (note that it will miss conflict that occurs when strong stabilizing selection is present in that sex). Finally it is proportional to the absolute intensity of selection.</p>
<p>Additionally, it has the desirable properties of being symmetrical and normally distributed for a random set of normally distributed <span class="math inline">\(B_F\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B_M\)</span>. |I| is also always included in the interval between the absolute values of the selection gradient in the two sexes, and it coincides with them when <span class="math inline">\(B_F\)</span> = <span class="math inline">\(B_M\)</span>. As a potential drawback, it should be noted that such quantity is not defined when <span class="math inline">\(B_F\)</span> = <span class="math inline">\(B_M\)</span> = 0, even though it makes little sense to estimate how concordant or antagonistic directional selection is when it is absent in both sexes.</p>
