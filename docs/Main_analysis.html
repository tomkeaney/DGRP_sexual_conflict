The results in this page were generated with repository version

See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made
to the R Markdown and HTML files.

<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:

<h1>Selecting data appropriate for analysis</h1>
<p>We use data compiled in the <em>DGRP database</em> (Belonte, Keaney,
<em>et al</em>. 2023).</p>
<p>First, we wrangle the data so that for each trait we have
standardised line mean values for females and males, as well as fitness
values for that line in females and males. We also include some helpful
metadata for downstream analysis.</p>
<p>We then pruned the dataset to only include traits (with standardised
values, where the mean = 0 and sd = 1) that have been measured in
single-sex cohorts, in 80 or more lines. We also remove ‘intermediate’
traits between genotype and phenotype from three mass datasets on the
microbiome and metabolome (Everett <em>et al</em>. 2020, Jin <em>et
al</em>. 2020 and Zhou <em>et al</em>. 2020).</p>

<h1>Calculating <em>R</em>: the response to selection</h1>
<p><span class="math inline">\(~\)</span></p>
<p>We assume that line means approximate the breeding value for a trait
for that given line, and that the variance across lines equals the
genetic variance in the DGRP population for that trait.</p>
<p>We can then estimate the response to selection (<span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span>) for a trait using <strong>Robertson’s
Secondary Theorem of Natural Selection</strong> (also known as the
<strong>Robertson covariance</strong>; Robertson, 1968), which states
that <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is equivalent to the
covariance between a traits breeding values (<span
class="math inline">\(A_z\)</span>) and the breeding values for relative
fitness (<span class="math inline">\(A_w\)</span>):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[R = \sigma(A_w, Az)\]</span> The
secondary theorem typically does not partition <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> between the sexes. However, because we
have <span class="math inline">\(A_w\)</span> values in both sexes and
often <span class="math inline">\(A_z\)</span> values for each sex, we
calculate four versions of <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>:</p>
<p>For traits expressed in females:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[R_{FF} = \sigma(A_w^F,
A_z^F)\]</span></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[R_{MF} = \sigma(A_w^M, A_z^F)\]</span>
For traits expressed in males:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[R_{MM} = \sigma(A_w^M,
A_z^M)\]</span></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[R_{FM} = \sigma(A_w^F,
A_z^M)\]</span></p>
<p>where the first subscripted letter indicates which sex breeding
values for fitness were measured in.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(R_{MF}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(R_{FM}\)</span> indicate the expected response
when a trait is measured in one sex and fitness is measured in the
other. We calculate these versions of <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> because a trait can respond to
selection acting on the other sex even if it is not expressed, because
the phenotype is a multivariate amalgamation of traits and genetic
correlations between traits are likely abundant. For example, alleles
encoding a female-specific CHC may also effect male desiccation
resistance, which could be under selection in males.</p>

<p>The <code>brms</code> model computes the posterior distribution of
the residual correlation between standardised trait and fitness breeding
values. Standardising traits to have standard deviation of 1 makes
correlation equal to covariance. For our own sanity, we plot the
residual correlation against covariance and show that, outside a small
amount of noise at the extremes, correlation ~ covariance. We calculated
point estimates of these variables for each trait measured in females

reveal whether a trait is truly sexually antagonistic, as a difference
is possible when a selection response is sexually concordant but with
sex differences in strength. A difference can also result from the
absence of a response in one sex and a strong response in the other.</p>

<p><strong>Figure S2</strong>. The response to selection in
<strong>a</strong> males and <strong>b</strong> females for all traits
measured in males. Innermost bands approximate the median, while outer
bands show the 66 and 95% credible intervals.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(~\)</span></p>
<p>Choose the top 20 traits measured in females in terms of absolute
<span class="math inline">\(R_{FF}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(R_{MF}\)</span> and present them in a Table</p>
<p><strong>Table 1</strong>. The traits in measured in females with the
strongest responses to selection in the DGRP. The sign of <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> indicates the direction of the
response, with positive expected responses bolded. Estimated error is
the standard deviation of the posterior distribution. The notable column
indicates that the 95% CI does not overlap zero.</p>

<h2>Identifying traits responding to sexually antagonistic
selection</h2>
<p><span class="math inline">\(~\)</span></p>
<p>We have found <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> for traits in
females and males. For those traits where we have a measure of both, we
can estimate the concordance of the response to selection between the
sexes using the I metric presented in <a
href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01021.x">Innocenti and
Morrow (2011)</a>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[I = \frac{\beta&#39;_M
\beta&#39;_F}{\sqrt{\frac{(\beta&#39;_M)^2 +
(\beta&#39;_F)^2}{2}}}\]</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(\beta&#39;_F\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\beta&#39;_M\)</span> = are phenotypic selection
gradients. Taking traits expressed in females as an example, we
substitute <span class="math inline">\(R_FF\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(R_MF\)</span> for <span
class="math inline">\(\beta&#39;_F\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\beta&#39;_M\)</span>. This makes our test for
sexually antagonistic traits more conservative, as non-zero <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> requires both directional selection on
the trait and the presence of additive genetic variance for the
trait.</p>
<p>This index is positive when selection is concordant in the two sexes,
negative when antagonistic in the two sexes, and is zero when selection
is absent in one sex (note that it will miss conflict that occurs when
strong stabilizing selection is present in that sex). Finally it is
proportional to the absolute intensity of selection (track the diagonals
in the visualisation below to get a sense of this). Note that because we
use <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> instead of <span
class="math inline">\(\beta&#39;\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(I\)</span> is bounded between -1 to 1 in our
analysis.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is symmetrical and normally distributed for a random
set of normally distributed <span
class="math inline">\(\beta&#39;_M\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\beta&#39;_F\)</span>. <span
class="math inline">\(|I|\)</span> is also always included in the
interval between the absolute values of the selection gradient in the
two sexes, and it coincides with them when <span
class="math inline">\(\beta&#39;_M = \beta&#39;_F\)</span>. As a
potential drawback, it should be noted that such quantity is not defined
when <span class="math inline">\(\beta&#39;_M = \beta&#39;_F =
0\)</span>.</p>
<p>First let’s look at the <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>
parameter space. We simulate combinations of <span
class="math inline">\(R_F\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(R_M\)</span> and calculate <span
class="math inline">\(I\)</span>.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 3</strong>. <strong>a</strong> The <em>I</em> index
parameter space for traits in the DGRP measured in females and males.
Each point indicates the median for a trait included in our analysis,
with the most sexually concordant and most sexually antagonistic
labelled. Contours show 0.075 intervals in <em>I</em>.
<strong>b</strong> the across trait mean <em>I</em>, split by the sex
traits were measured in. Red area indicates parameter space where traits
have sexually antagonistic responses to selection, while green area
indicates traits that have sexually concordant responses to selection.
White points show the median, with associated 66 and 95% credible
intervals.</p>

Higher values indicate more active lines.","Mean proportion of surviving 7-day old adult flies, 24 hours after a one-hour cold shock treatment at -6C. Higher values indicate greater resistance to cold shock.","Mean number of days required for 50% of 20 flies to die (LT50) when exposed to the fungal pathogen Metarhizium anisopliae (Ma549). Higher values indicate greater resistance to Ma549.","Mean number of days required for 50% of 20 flies to die (LT50) when exposed to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomos aeruginosa (Pa14). Higher values indicate greater resistance to Pa14.","Fecundity was estimated every other week of the female’s lifespan as a 2-day total of eggs laid, when living with a single standard male, at 25C. Lifetime fecundity was estimated as the sum of all egg counts across the female's lifespan. Higher values indicate greater fecundity. Note that female's were eliminated form the analysis upon death.","Mean chromatogram peak, for a particular Cuticular Hydrocarbon (CHC). Data are originally displayed as a proportion from all CHCs detected. The name of each CHC can be deciphered as follows: linear alkanes are referred to by the abbreviation n-Cx, where ‘‘x’’ is the total carbon number. Methyl-branched alkanes are referred to with a y-Me-Cx prefix, where ’y’ is the carbon onto which the methyl group is bound. For example, 9-Me-C23 is a 23 carbon chain with a methyl on the 9th carbon. For monoenes (z-Cx:1) and dienes (z,z-Cx:2) the number of double bonds is indicated after the colon and the double bond position/s are ’z’ or ’z,z\"). For example, 7-C23:1 has one double bond between the 7th and 8th carbons. Higher peaks indicate a greater amount of the CHC.","Mean fecundity in the first week of a female's adult life, measured as a 2-day total of eggs laid, when living with a single standard male, at 25C.

Note that the data presented in this study were originally collected by Mackay et al (2012).","Mean chromatogram peak, for a particular Cuticular Hydrocarbon (CHC). Data are originally displayed as a proportion from all CHCs detected. The name of each CHC can be deciphered as follows: linear alkanes are referred to by the abbreviation n-Cx, where ‘‘x’’ is the total carbon number. Methyl-branched alkanes are referred to with a y-Me-Cx prefix, where ’y’ is the carbon onto which the methyl group is bound. For example, 9-Me-C23 is a 23 carbon chain with a methyl on the 9th carbon. For monoenes (z-Cx:1) and dienes (z,z-Cx:2) the number of double bonds is indicated after the colon and the double bond position/s are ’z’ or ’z,z\"). For example, 7-C23:1 has one double bond between the 7th and 8th carbons. Higher peaks indicate a greater amount of the CHC.","The critical thermal minimum (CT min), which is defined as the temperature at which a complete cessation of movement is observed as a result of the fly entering chill coma. Egg-to-adult development occurred at 23C. Higher values indicate a higher CT min.","Mean Interocular distance. This is measured from eye edge to eye edge along the anterior edge of the posterior ocelli and palel to the base of the head. Higher values indicate a greater distance between the eyes.","Mean difference in aggressive behavior between male flies raised in social and socially isolated environments. Higher values indicate that males raised in a social environment were more aggressive than males experiencing isolation (the authors adjusted line means to meet normality expectations, we present udjusted means for the social and isolation line means).","Mean hours survived in culture vials containing non-nutritive medium. Higher values indicate greater starvation resistance.","Mean protein (mg/ul) extracted from 10 flies that were reared on a diet containing 5% glucose. Higher values indicate greater levels of protein.","Mean hours survived when exposed to food medium supplemented with paraquat (20 mM/50ml concentration). Paraquat is a herbicide that facilitates oxidative stress induced mortality. Higher values indicate greater resistance to oxidative stress.","Mean protein (mg/ul) extracted from 10 flies that were reared on a diet containing 10% glucose. Higher values indicate greater levels of protein.","Mean within-line (micro-environmental) variance in lifespan at 28C. Such micro-environmental variance may be due to the plasticity of lifespan in response to unmeasured environmental variation and intrinsic variability of each individual genotype. Higher values indicate greater variance in lifespan.","Adult mean survival in the absence of food after two days is here used as a measure of starvation resistance. Higher values indicate greater survival and therefore higher starvation resistance.","Exercise induced activity levels, measured as the mean number of times a fly crossed a beam running down the midline of a vial, within a five minute interval. Activity was induced by vertically rotating vials at four rpm. Higher values indicate higher exercise induced activity levels.","Mean adult lifespan when reared at 18C, measured in days. Higher values indicate longer-lived flies.","Mean proportion of surviving 28-day old adult flies, 24 hours after a one-hour cold shock treatment at -6C. Flies were acclimated at 4C for two hours immediately preceeding cold shock. Higher values indicate greater resistance to cold shock.","Median interpulse interval (IPI) in the male courtship 'song'. Males in many Drosophila species produce a series of auditory pulses (a pulse 'song') when courting females, and the pause between pulses (IPI) varies greatly among species. Higher values indicate a longer IPI.","Mean mortality after 6 hours of exposure to melathion, an organophosphate pesticide. Higher values indicate greater susceptibility to melathion.","Mean PC2 score for posterior lobe shape, calculated from 200 Fourier coefficients. The posterior lobe is a genital structure used to grasp the female oviscape to ensure stable genital coupling. PC1 explains 10% of the variation in shape, and describes the width of the posterior lobes. Higher values indicate wider lobes.","Mean change in the combined dry weight of 5 adult flies that possessed a microbiome compared with flies that lacked a microbiome. All micro-organisms were purged from egg-surfaces via dechorionation and larvae were reared either on sterile medium or on medium supplemented with Acetobacter pomorum, Acetobacter tropicalis, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus fructivorans and Lactobacillus plantarum. All are common commensal bacteria that make up a large proportion of the D. melanogaster microbiome. Higher values indicate that the addition of microbiota had a greater positive effect on weight. Note that the presence of micriobiota on average increased dry weight.","Mean chromatogram peak, for a particular Cuticular Hydrocarbon (CHC). Data are originally displayed as a proportion from all CHCs detected. The name of each CHC can be deciphered as follows: linear alkanes are referred to by the abbreviation n-Cx, where ‘‘x’’ is the total carbon number. Methyl-branched alkanes are referred to with a y-Me-Cx prefix, where ’y’ is the carbon onto which the methyl group is bound. For example, 9-Me-C23 is a 23 carbon chain with a methyl on the 9th carbon. For monoenes (z-Cx:1) and dienes (z,z-Cx:2) the number of double bonds is indicated after the colon and the double bond position/s are ’z’ or ’z,z\"). For example, 7-C23:1 has one double bond between the 7th and 8th carbons. Higher peaks indicate a greater amount of the CHC.","Mean leg length for legs originating on the second thoracic segment. Higher values indicate longer legs","Mean triglycerides (mg/ul) extracted from 10 flies that were reared on a diet containing 2.5% glucose. Higher values indicate greater levels of triglycerides.","Mean chromatogram peak, for a particular Cuticular Hydrocarbon (CHC). Data are originally displayed as a proportion from all CHCs detected. The name of each CHC can be deciphered as follows: linear alkanes are referred to by the abbreviation n-Cx, where ‘‘x’’ is the total carbon number.

For example, 7-C23:1 has one double bond between the 7th and 8th carbons. Higher peaks indicate a greater amount of the CHC.","Mean chromatogram peak, for a particular Cuticular Hydrocarbon (CHC). Data are originally displayed as a proportion from all CHCs detected. NI indicates that the chemical composition could not be identified and the number following allows differentiation between CHCs without chemical profiles. Higher peaks indicate a greater amount of the CHC.","Mean phototaxis score measured in 28 day old adults. Higher values indicate a stronger phototaxic response.","Mean hours survived when exposed to food medium supplemented with medione sodium bisulfite (MSB; 75 mM total). MSB facilitates oxidative stress induced mortality. Higher values indicate greater resistance to oxidative stress.","Mean proportion of adult flies surviving one hours of exposure to -8°C, for flies reared at 18°C. Higher values indicate greater resistance to acute cold exposure.","Mean number of flies that moved away from a cotton wool swab that had been dipped in Methyl salicylate solution. Higher values indicate avoidance of Methyl salicylate, lower values indicate attraction.","Mean number of flies that moved away from a cotton wool swab that had been dipped in Citral solution. Higher values indicate avoidance of Citral, lower values indicate attraction.","The critical thermal maximum, which is defined as the mean temperature in °C at which a fly loses motor function. Higher values indicate a higher CT max.","Mean free glucose (mg/ul) extracted from 10 flies that were reared on a diet containing 10% glucose. Higher values indicate greater levels of free glucose.","Mean response of flies to a dipstick assay using 0.3% benzaldehyde. Higher values indicate aversion, lower values indicate attraction.","Mean slope of the change in male fertility (the proportion of males that produced viable larvae), between 25C, 27C and 29C rearing conditions. Lower slope values indicate a greater decrease in fertility with an increase in temperature. This is a measure of thermal susceptibility.","Mean time required for 50% of male flies exposed to tunicamycin (TM) media to die. TM is an antibiotic that causes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Higher values indicate longer survival times and greater resistance to ER stress.","Mean chromatogram peak, for a particular Cuticular Hydrocarbon (CHC). Data are originally displayed as a proportion from all CHCs detected. The name of each CHC can be deciphered as follows: linear alkanes are referred to by the abbreviation n-Cx, where ‘‘x’’ is the total carbon number.

Higher values indicate longer bouts.","The percent of activity performed in the first quarter of a two hour induced exercise period. The author reasons that this is a measure of the tendency to behave like a sprinter versus a marathoner. Note: this data is recoded from that recorded by Watanabe et al (2020).","The critical thermal maximum, which is defined as the mean temperature in °C at which a fly loses motor function. Higher values indicate a higher CT max.","The standard deviation for the length of a sleep bout during the 12-hour light period of the light cycle. Standard deviations are used to estimate the inter-individual variation in sleep. Higher values indicate more within-individual variation in sleep bout length. Note that this study reanalyses the data collected in Harbison, McCoy and Mackay (2013).","Strongest observed response to 2,3-buntanedione, an odorant present in fermenting fruit. Higher values indicate greater attraction to the odorant.","Median latency (seconds) to achieve 30% of the entire observed response to 2,3-buntanedione, an odorant present in fermenting fruit. Lower values indicate a greater ability to detect and respond to the odorant.","Mean chromatogram peak, for a particular Cuticular Hydrocarbon (CHC). Data are originally displayed as a proportion from all CHCs detected. The name of each CHC can be deciphered as follows: linear alkanes are referred to by the abbreviation n-Cx, where ‘‘x’’ is the total carbon number. Methyl-branched alkanes are referred to with a y-Me-Cx prefix, where ’y’ is the carbon onto which the methyl group is bound. For example, 9-Me-C23 is a 23 carbon chain with a methyl on the 9th carbon. For monoenes (z-Cx:1) and dienes (z,z-Cx:2) the number of double bonds is indicated after the colon and the double bond position/s are ’z’ or ’z,z\"). For example, 7-C23:1 has one double bond between the 7th and 8th carbons. Higher peaks indicate a greater amount of the CHC.","Mean survival of adults, 24 hours after vials were inoculated with 0.5 ug/ml of DDT. This is a historically used pesticide that targets the voltage gated sodium channel, resulting in uncontrolled nerve firing.

For example, 9-Me-C23 is a 23 carbon chain with a methyl on the 9th carbon. For monoenes (z-Cx:1) and dienes (z,z-Cx:2) the number of double bonds is indicated after the colon and the double bond position/s are ’z’ or ’z,z\"). For example, 7-C23:1 has one double bond between the 7th and 8th carbons. Higher peaks indicate a greater amount of the CHC.","Mean proportion of surviving 7-day old adult flies, 24 hours after a one-hour cold shock treatment at -6C. Higher values indicate greater resistance to cold shock.","Standard deviation for the number of times the fly crossed the infrared beam used to measure activity, divided by the total time spent awake. Standard deviations are used to estimate the inter-individual variation in sleep. Higher values indicate more variable within-individual activity. Note that this study reanalyses the data collected in Harbison, McCoy and Mackay (2013).","Mean adult thorax length when reared at 28C. Higher values indicate larger flies.","Mean chromatogram peak, for a particular Cuticular Hydrocarbon (CHC). Data are originally displayed as a proportion from all CHCs detected.

Variance is used as a measure of micro-environmental plasticity. Higher values indicate a more variable startle response, and therefore greater micro-environmental plasticity. Note that the data presented in this study was originally collected by Mackay et al (2012).","Mean number of flies that moved away from a cotton wool swab that had been dipped in Acetophenone solution. Higher values indicate avoidance of Acetophenone, lower values indicate attraction.","Mean time a fly was active in the 45 seconds following a mechanical disturbance.

This was measured by exposing one group of flies to a mild pre-treatment temperature (4 degrees C) before exposing them to a cold temperature (-6 degrees C), while another group of flies was immediately exposed to the cold temperature. RCH = prop survival after hardening – prop survival without hardening. These flies were reared at 25C and RCH was measured when adults were 28-days old. Higher values indicate a greater plastic response.","The standard deviation for the length of a sleep bout during the 12-hour light period of the light cycle. Standard deviations are used to estimate the inter-individual variation in sleep. Higher values indicate more within-individual variation in sleep bout length. Note that this study reanalyses the data collected in Harbison, McCoy and Mackay (2013).","The mean length of a sleep bout during the 12-hour light period of the light cycle. Higher values indicate longer bouts.","Mean proportion of surviving 28-day old adult flies, 24 hours after a one-hour cold shock treatment at -6C. Flies were acclimated at 4C for two hours immediately preceeding cold shock. Higher values indicate greater resistance to cold shock.","Mean difference in Dopamine content (pg/ng tissue) extracted from the heads of two flies, after 24 hours of exposure to sucrose or sucrose supplemented with paraquat (200 uM in 1% sucrose solution). Paraquat is a herbicide that causes oxidative stress in D. melanogaster. Higher values indicate greater resistance to paraquat and the effects of oxidative stress on Dopamine content.","Mean difference in centimetres climbed in three seconds following vial inversion, after 24 hours of exposure to sucrose or sucrose supplemented with paraquat (200 uM in 1% sucrose solution). Paraquat is a herbicide that causes oxidative stress in D. melanogaster.

For example, 9-Me-C23 is a 23 carbon chain with a methyl on the 9th carbon. For monoenes (z-Cx:1) and dienes (z,z-Cx:2) the number of double bonds is indicated after the colon and the double bond position/s are ’z’ or ’z,z\"). For example, 7-C23:1 has one double bond between the 7th and 8th carbons. Higher peaks indicate a greater amount of the CHC.","Mean chromatogram peak, for a particular Cuticular Hydrocarbon (CHC).

These flies were reared at 25C and the stravation trial started when adults were 7-days old.  Higher values indicate flies that exhibited greater starvation resistance.","Mean hours survived when exposed to food medium supplemented with paraquat (20 mM/50ml concentration). Paraquat is a herbicide that facilitates oxidative stress induced mortality. Higher values indicate greater resistance to oxidative stress.","Rapid cold hardening; a type of phenotypic plasticity that allows ectotherms to quickly enhance cold tolerance in response to brief chilling (lasting minutes to hours). This was measured by exposing one group of flies to a mild pre-treatment temperature (4 degrees C) before exposing them to a cold temperature (-6 degrees C), while another group of flies was immediately exposed to the cold temperature. RCH = prop survival after hardening – prop survival without hardening. These flies were reared at 25C. Higher values indicate a greater plastic response.","Mean difference in startle response between flies reared on medium supplemented with medione sodium bisulfite (MSB; 3 mM concentration) and flies reared on standard medium. Calculated as the difference between control and MSB conditions, divided by the population mean difference between control and MSB conditions. MSB facilitates oxidative stress induced mortality. Higher values indicate a greater sensitivity to oxidative stress and a more compromised startle response.","Strongest observed response to 2,3-buntanedione, an odorant present in fermenting fruit. Higher values indicate greater attraction to the odorant.","Mean number of aggressive encounters between 8 males in an interaction vial over a two minute duration. Higher values indicate more aggressive males.","Mean chromatogram peak, for a particular Cuticular Hydrocarbon (CHC). Data are originally displayed as a proportion from all CHCs detected.

For example, 7-C23:1 has one double bond between the 7th and 8th carbons. Higher peaks indicate a greater amount of the CHC.","Mean combined dry weight of 5 adult flies that possessed a microbiome. All micro-organisms were purged from egg-surfaces via dechorionation and larvae were reared on medium supplemented with Acetobacter pomorum, Acetobacter tropicalis, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus fructivorans and Lactobacillus plantarum. All are common commensal bacteria that make up a large proportion of the D. melanogaster microbiome. Higher values indicate heavier flies.","Mean number of flies that moved away from a cotton wool swab that had been dipped in Benzaldehyde solution. Higher values indicate avoidance of Benzaldehyde, lower values indicate attraction.","Mean number of flies that moved away from a cotton wool swab that had been dipped in l-Carvone solution. Higher values indicate avoidance of l-Carvone, lower values indicate attraction.","Mean height climbed in 5 seconds (expressed as 26 5mm bins). Higher values indicate faster climbing and greater negative geotaxis.","Mean glycerol (mg/ul) extracted from 10 flies that were reared on a diet containing 2.5% glucose. Higher values indicate greater levels of glycerol.","Survival time in hours for adult flies that were first flies maintained on a high carbohydrate diet (carbs:494.15g/L, protein:52g/L, fat:2.5g/L) for 10 days, then starved in vials supplied only with water. Higher values indicate greater starvation resistance.","Mean proportion of adult flies surviving one hours of exposure to -6°C, for flies reared at 18°C. Higher values indicate greater resistance to acute cold exposure.","Mean glycerol (mg/ul) extracted from 10 flies that were reared on a diet containing 5% glucose. Higher values indicate greater levels of glycerol.","Exercise induced activity levels, measured as the mean number of times a fly crossed a beam running down the midline of a vial, within a five minute interval. Activity was induced by vertically rotating vials at four rpm. Higher values indicate higher exercise induced activity levels.","Mean proportion of surviving 7-day old adult flies, 24 hours after a one-hour cold shock treatment at -6C. Higher values indicate greater resistance to cold shock.","Mean number of days required for 50% of 20 flies to die (LT50) when exposed to the fungal pathogen Metarhizium anisopliae (Ma549). Higher values indicate greater resistance to Ma549.","Mean number of times adult flies crossed an infrared beam over a 2-day period, after developing at 25C on food medium supplemented with 0.5 mM lead acetate. Higher values indicate greater locomotor activity.","Strength of attraction to 2,3-buntanedione, an odorant present in fermenting fruit. Higher values indicate greater attraction to the odorant.","Mean number of days required for 50% of 20 flies to die (LT50) when exposed to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomos aeruginosa (Pa14). Higher values indicate greater resistance to Pa14.","The standard deviation for the sum of periods of inactivity lasting &gt; 5 minutes (the studies definition of sleep) during the 12-hour light period of the light cycle. Standard deviations are used to estimate the inter-individual variation in sleep. Higher values indicate more within-individual variation in sleep duration. Note that this study reanalyses the data collected in Harbison, McCoy and Mackay (2013).","Mean chromatogram peak, for a particular Cuticular Hydrocarbon (CHC). Data are originally displayed as a proportion from all CHCs detected. The name of each CHC can be deciphered as follows: linear alkanes are referred to by the abbreviation n-Cx, where ‘‘x’’ is the total carbon number.

For example, 7-C23:1 has one double bond between the 7th and 8th carbons. Higher peaks indicate a greater amount of the CHC.","Mean within-line (micro-environmental) variance in lifespan at 18C. Such micro-environmental variance may be due to the plasticity of lifespan in response to unmeasured environmental variation and intrinsic variability of each individual genotype. Higher values indicate greater variance in lifespan.","Attraction to 2,3-buntanedione, an odorant present in fermenting fruit. Lower values indicate greater attraction to the odorant.","Mean chromatogram peak, for a particular Cuticular Hydrocarbon (CHC). Data are originally displayed as a proportion from all CHCs detected.

Higher values indicate greater resistance to Ma549.","The proportion of flies engaging in a ‘walking bout’ at a given time point. Higher values indicate more active lines.","Mean proportion of surviving 7-day old adult flies, 24 hours after a one-hour cold shock treatment at -6C. Higher values indicate greater resistance to cold shock.","The mean length of a sleep bout during the 12-hour light period of the light cycle. Higher values indicate longer bouts.","The percent of activity performed in the first quarter of a two hour induced exercise period. The author reasons that this is a measure of the tendency to behave like a sprinter versus a marathoner. Note: this data is recoded from that recorded by Watanabe et al (2020).","Mean number of days required for 50% of 20 flies to die (LT50) when exposed to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomos aeruginosa (Pa14). Higher values indicate greater resistance to Pa14.","The standard deviation for the length of a sleep bout during the 12-hour light period of the light cycle. Standard deviations are used to estimate the inter-individual variation in sleep. Higher values indicate more within-individual variation in sleep bout length. Note that this study reanalyses the data collected in Harbison, McCoy and Mackay (2013).","Mean chromatogram peak, for a particular Cuticular Hydrocarbon (CHC). Data are originally displayed as a proportion from all CHCs detected. The name of each CHC can be deciphered as follows: linear alkanes are referred to by the abbreviation n-Cx, where ‘‘x’’ is the total carbon number. Methyl-branched alkanes are referred to with a y-Me-Cx prefix, where ’y’ is the carbon onto which the methyl group is bound. For example, 9-Me-C23 is a 23 carbon chain with a methyl on the 9th carbon. For monoenes (z-Cx:1) and dienes (z,z-Cx:2) the number of double bonds is indicated after the colon and the double bond position/s are ’z’ or ’z,z\"). For example, 7-C23:1 has one double bond between the 7th and 8th carbons. Higher peaks indicate a greater amount of the CHC.","Mean chromatogram peak, for a particular Cuticular Hydrocarbon (CHC).

Prior to phenotyping flies were exposed to food medium supplemented with medione sodium bisulfite (MSB; 3 mM concentration). MSB facilitates oxidative stress. Higher values indicate faster climbing and greater negative geotaxis.","Fecundity was estimated every other week of the female’s lifespan as a 2-day total of eggs laid, when living with a single standard male, at 25C. Lifetime fecundity was estimated as the sum of all egg counts across the female's lifespan. Higher values indicate greater fecundity. Note that female's were eliminated form the analysis upon death.","Mean phototaxis score measured in 14 day old adults. Higher values indicate a stronger phototaxic response.","Mean proportion of surviving 28-day old adult flies, 24 hours after a one-hour cold shock treatment at -6C.

Higher values indicate greater resistance to cold shock.","Mean number of days required for 50% of 20 flies to die (LT50) when exposed to the fungal pathogen Metarhizium anisopliae (Ma549). Higher values indicate greater resistance to Ma549.","Mean number of days required for 50% of 20 flies to die (LT50) when exposed to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomos aeruginosa (Pa14). Higher values indicate greater resistance to Pa14.","Mean ln(bacterial load) per fly, 24 hours after infection with P. rettgeri, a bacterial pathogen. Prior to infection, flies were reared on a diet containing 10% glucose. Higher values indicate a greater bacterial load.","Mean combined triglyceride (TAG) content after glycerol substraction extracted from 5 adult flies that possessed a microbiome, after controlling for dry weight. All micro-organisms were purged from egg-surfaces via dechorionation and larvae were reared on medium supplemented with Acetobacter pomorum, Acetobacter tropicalis, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus fructivorans and Lactobacillus plantarum. All are common commensal bacteria that make up a large proportion of the D. melanogaster microbiome. Higher values indicate higher TAG content.","Rapid cold hardening; a type of phenotypic plasticity that allows ectotherms to quickly enhance cold tolerance in response to brief chilling (lasting minutes to hours). This was measured by exposing one group of flies to a mild pre-treatment temperature (4 degrees C) before exposing them to a cold temperature (-6 degrees C), while another group of flies was immediately exposed to the cold temperature. RCH = prop survival after hardening – prop survival without hardening. These flies were reared at 25C and RCH was measured when adults were 28-days old. Higher values indicate a greater plastic response.","The standard deviation for the length of a sleep bout during the 12-hour light period of the light cycle.

Higher values indicate a greater plastic response.","Mean chromatogram peak, for a particular Cuticular Hydrocarbon (CHC). Data are originally displayed as a proportion from all CHCs detected. The name of each CHC can be deciphered as follows: linear alkanes are referred to by the abbreviation n-Cx, where ‘‘x’’ is the total carbon number. Methyl-branched alkanes are referred to with a y-Me-Cx prefix, where ’y’ is the carbon onto which the methyl group is bound. For example, 9-Me-C23 is a 23 carbon chain with a methyl on the 9th carbon. For monoenes (z-Cx:1) and dienes (z,z-Cx:2) the number of double bonds is indicated after the colon and the double bond position/s are ’z’ or ’z,z\"). For example, 7-C23:1 has one double bond between the 7th and 8th carbons. Higher peaks indicate a greater amount of the CHC.","Mean chromatogram peak, for a particular Cuticular Hydrocarbon (CHC).
