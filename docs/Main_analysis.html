Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/tomkeaney/DGRP_sexual_conflict/tree/42b8f12ec94d1089c153f97f0e4090edd191a279" target="_blank">42b8f12</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .DS_Store
    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    .Rproj.user/

Untracked files:
    Untracked:  data/all.dgrp.phenos_unscaled.csv

Unstaged changes:
    Modified:   analysis/_site.yml

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to have uncommitted changes.

<p><strong>Figure 1</strong>: The intersex genetic correlation (r<sup>A</sup><sub><em>fm</em></sub>) for fitness across the DGRP. The orange points each represent a DGRP line, and where it falls on the female-male fitness continuum. Data points are standardised to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This means that lines that have negative values have lower than average fitness, while lines that have positive values have above average fitness. The dotted lines separate the plot into four quadrants: lines that fall within the top left quadrant have above average male fitness, but below average female fitness, lines in the top right have above average fitness for both sexes, lines in the bottom left have below average fitness in both sexes, and lines in the bottom right have below average fitness in males, but above average fitness in females.</p>

<h2>Calculating <em>S</em>: the selection differential</h2>
<p>We can calculate the selection differential associated with each phenotype using the <strong>Robertson Price identity</strong>, which states that the selection differential is equivalent to the covariance between phenotype and relative fitness</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(S = \sigma(w_i, z_i)\)</span></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(S = cov(relative.fitness, standarised.phenotype)\)</span></p>
<p>We can also calculate the broad sense heritability associated with each phenotype… if we could calculate the narrow sense heritability we could use the <strong>Breeder’s equation</strong> to calculate the response to selection for each phenotype (seems unlikely).</p>
<p><strong>Table 1:</strong> Selection coefficients (<span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>) for each phenotype, when expressed in each sex. The antagonism index column shows how different selection on the trait is in the two sexes. Postive values indcate that the trait has a more positive selection differential in females than it does in males, a value of 0 indicates that the selection differential is the same in each sex, and negative values indicate a more positive selection differential in males compared to females.</p>

<p>There are some issues here. It does not make sense to calculate the covariance between e.g. female fitness and a phenotype expressed in males, when we also have a measure of the phenotype in females.</p>

<p>While this figure comes from relatively rough data, we can see that trait values that are postively selected in females tend also to be positively selected in males. However, there are numerous traits that appear to be under sexually antagonstic selection: that is, trait values that make fit males make low fitness females and vice versa.</p>
